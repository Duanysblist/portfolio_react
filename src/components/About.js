          Hey there! I'm Dan, aspiring software developer and ex-cook. I spend
          most of my days trying to absorb as much information as I can. I've
          worked on building full stack web applications in Java using
          Bootstrap, JQuery, Maven, Spring, and MySQL.I've also been gaining
          more experience using React and Redux, even creating a full stack web
          application using the MERN stack. I've gone to an exhaustingly long
          list of meetups and have even done the Grow With Google CUNY Hackathon
          in an attempt to make a voice controlled device to help students with
          diasbilities in the classroom.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm really looking for a forward-thinking company to work for that I
          can pour myself into. I've played around with Android application
          development as well as Angular. My attention lies in mobile
          application development, but I can definitely be swayed by the right
          company and culture.
